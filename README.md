# RD-INFO-TECHNOLOGY
This project is done during my internship with RDInfoTechnology. It is a Diabetes Prediction System driven by machine learning, which takes health input data to predict whether an individual is diabetic or not. The system is implemented using Python, Flask, and Scikit-learn, and is hosted as a responsive web application.
